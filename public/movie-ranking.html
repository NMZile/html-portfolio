<h1>The Best Movies According To Niña</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<h3>Harry Potter</h3> 
<p>I’ve always loved the Harry Potter series because it’s just so immersive. 
    Growing up with it, you feel like you’re part of that magical world. 
    It’s not just about the spells and creatures, though—that story of friendship, loyalty, and standing up for what’s right really hits home. 
    Plus, it’s got so many life lessons packed in. 
    Every time I rewatch it, I find something new that makes me appreciate it even more.</p>

<h3>Miracle in Cell No. 7</h3>
<p>This movie is a rollercoaster of emotions and hit me in the feels like nothing else. 
    It’s such a heart-wrenching story about a father-daughter relationship, and it shows how powerful love can be, even in the worst situations. 
    But, it also makes you think about the justice system and how it can fail people.
    I cry every time I watch it, but it’s worth it for that ending. 
    It’s one of those movies that stays with you long after you’ve watched it because of how deep it is.

<h3>Titanic (1997)</h3>
<p>Titanic is a classic for a reason. 
    The whole love story between Jack and Rose is iconic, and the way the movie builds up to the sinking is super intense. 
    You get caught up in the romance and the historical aspect, but what really gets me is the way it shows the human side of a tragedy. 
    It’s also beautifully made and has that epic feel that makes it stand out.</p>
